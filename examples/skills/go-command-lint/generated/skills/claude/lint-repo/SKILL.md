# Lint Repository

## What it does

Checks that the example skill package keeps its canonical `SKILL.md`, generated artifacts, and command doc in sync.

## When to use

Use this when you want a small but real Go-backed skill example instead of a placeholder command stub.

## How to run

Run `go run ./cmd/lint-repo` from the example root.

## Constraints

- This is a non-interactive command.
- It assumes the current directory is the example checkout.
- Diagnostics go to stdout and stderr; fix the reported issues before rerunning.
