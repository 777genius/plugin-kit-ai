## Canonical instructions

# Format Changed Files

## What it does

Runs a repository formatter through an existing external CLI instead of custom Go code.

## When to use

Use this when the repository already standardizes on a formatter and you want a reusable skill wrapper around it.

## How to run

Run `npx prettier@3.4.2 --write .` from the repository root or adapt the command to the subset of files you want to format.

## Constraints

- This is a non-interactive command.
- It may download dependencies on the first run.
- It writes files in place, so review the diff after execution.
