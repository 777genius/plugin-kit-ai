# Verification record

Date: 2026-08-07.

## Package conformance

- 26 root `plugin.json` documents pass the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 JSON Schema.
- 25 root `mcp.json` documents pass the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 MCP Schema.
- 4 skills pass `skills-ref` 0.1.1.
- The repository semantic validator reports 26 plugins, 25 MCP servers, and 4
  skills.
- All 26 generated OpenAI compatibility packages pass the repository validator
  and OpenAI's `plugin-creator` validator in CI. The latter is fetched from a
  pinned `openai/codex` commit and verified by SHA-256 before execution.
- The OpenAI adapter preserves the host-specific auth metadata published for
  GitHub, Figma, Linear, and Notion without adding unverified auth fields.

## Dependency verification

The npm registry stable tags were checked before pinning:

- `chrome-devtools-mcp@1.6.0`
- `@upstash/context7-mcp@4.0.0`
- `firebase-tools@15.26.0`
- `@hubspot/cli@8.12.0`

The Docker Hub package is pinned to the multi-architecture OCI digest recorded
in `plugins/docker-hub/mcp.json`.

## Runtime E2E

- MCP Inspector 2.1.0 completed 12 expected checks with zero unexpected
  results. Context7 and Cloudflare Docs passed representative read calls;
  Chrome DevTools exposed 29 tools from a disposable sandbox.
- Codex CLI 0.144.1 added the local marketplace, installed Context7 and Agent
  Code Navigator, called the Context7 MCP tool, and executed the packaged
  diagnostic skill in fresh disposable repositories.
- Codex CLI 0.144.1 also added the public GitHub marketplace, installed Context7
  from the cloned compatibility package, and returned
  `REMOTE_INSTALL_OK /microsoft/playwright` from a fresh disposable repository.
- Cursor 3.9.16 loaded the portable Context7 package from its local plugin
  directory, started version 4.0.0, and completed the stdio MCP connection in
  an isolated user-data directory.
- ChatGPT web Plugins Directory was verified in a signed-in session. Developer
  mode was enabled with explicit user consent, ChatGPT created a development
  connection for `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`, completed Notion OAuth, and ran an
  authenticated read-only search for a synthetic probe. ChatGPT returned
  `UAP_NOTION_E2E_OK 0` without page titles or content. This verifies the raw MCP
  endpoint and OAuth flow, not installation of this repository's package. The
  interactive check used a user-approved personal account and workspace, not a
  dedicated test account. The connection was then removed and Developer Mode
  was restored to disabled. Provider-side settings still showed ChatGPT as
  connected. Notion offered only a workspace-wide disconnect that would also
  revoke an unrelated existing MCP client, so it was not used and cleanup is
  recorded as partial rather than complete.

Sanitized structured client evidence is committed under
[`tests/e2e/results`](../tests/e2e/results).

## Remote endpoint reachability

Every configured remote HTTPS origin returned an HTTP response during a
non-authenticated reachability check. Expected results were `401` for protected
origins, `405` for origins that reject a normal GET, and `200` for public web
frontends. The Sentry MCP endpoint was corrected to `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp`
after the live handshake exposed the web-root mismatch.

This proves DNS, TLS, and origin reachability only. It does not prove MCP
handshake behavior, OAuth compatibility, account scoping, or tool correctness.

## Deliberately not tested

No destructive tool, write operation, or real user project was used. Successful
Notion OAuth consent was completed interactively on a user-approved personal
workspace, followed by one synthetic read-only search, immediate client cleanup,
and a provider-side revocation check. Provider cleanup remains explicitly partial
for the reason recorded above.
Evidence excludes credentials, account/workspace identity, cookies, OAuth codes,
state, tokens, page titles, and page content. Automated and repeatable OAuth
tests must use a dedicated test account or workspace.
