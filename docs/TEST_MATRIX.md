# Plugin verification matrix

Updated on 2026-08-10. Each column is independent: a schema pass is not an
install, an auth challenge is not OAuth success, and tool discovery is not a
tool call. `Direct harness` means MCP Inspector, not a client installation.

| Plugin | Schema | Installed | Tool called | OAuth | Clients |

The automated Codex record includes the public release ref and commit, workflow
URL and commit, copy-ready reproduction commands, and a sanitized three-event
transcript. All client records are under [`tests/e2e/results`](../tests/e2e/results).

The [Cloudflare Docs ChatGPT record](../tests/e2e/results/chatgpt-cloudflare-docs-direct-2026-08-10.json)
proves only a direct registered no-auth development connection: `list_resources`
and one read-only search passed. The separate [personal-app record](../tests/e2e/results/chatgpt-cloudflare-docs-personal-app-2026-08-10.json)
proves Installed discovery under Personal, user-attested manual activation,
exact app ID linkage, and one read-only prompt with exactly two tool calls. It
does not prove local `.codex-plugin` ingestion, repository marketplace
installation, or the `agentplugins` manager lifecycle.

## Installer lifecycle

| Installer | Catalog | Package add/remove | Client runtime | OAuth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`agentplugins 0.1.5` post-merge run](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/actions/runs/31332320890) | 26/26 pinned | 26/26 passed in an isolated Cursor provider HOME | Not implied | Not tested |
| `agentplugins 0.1.5`, hero projections | 5 pinned hero packages | 25/25 add/remove flows across isolated Codex, Cursor, Copilot, VS Code, and Kiro projections | Not implied | Not tested |
| `agentplugins 0.1.5` + Copilot CLI 1.0.78 | 5 pinned hero packages | 5/5 automatic marketplace registration, native install, verification, uninstall, and marketplace cleanup in an isolated HOME | Not implied | Not tested |
| Interactive hero runtime matrix | 5 local packages | Client-specific test loading in Codex, Cursor, and Kiro | 15/15 checks passed across 3 clients | 3/3 Notion OAuth + read-only runtime passed |
| [Interactive Codex Figma check](../tests/e2e/results/codex-figma-oauth-2026-08-09.json) | `figma 0.1.0` via `agentplugins 0.1.5` | Add, install/enable, and cleanup passed in isolated profiles | Read-only Figma MCP `whoami` passed | Figma OAuth passed in Codex only |

The first three rows come from public run `31332320890` at merge
[`8c2be5a`](https://github.com/777genius/universal-agent-plugins/commit/8c2be5a4740f0cef8b8dd8e57e51757e1f1167ea).
They prove source resolution, package validation, transactional lifecycle, and
native Copilot lifecycle only. They do not prove client tool runtime or OAuth;
those claims stay separate in the interactive row. Sanitized GitHub Actions
evidence artifacts are retained for 30 days on the linked run.

The Figma record is a separate sanitized interactive Codex check. It does not
claim Figma installation, OAuth, or runtime in ChatGPT, Cursor, Kiro, or Copilot.
