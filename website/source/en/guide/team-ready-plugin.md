# Build A Team-Ready Plugin

This tutorial picks up where the first successful plugin stops. The goal is not just “it works on my machine,” but a repo another teammate can clone, validate, and ship without hidden knowledge.

## Outcome

By the end, you should have:

- a package-standard authored repo
- generated files reproduced from the project source
- a strict validation check that passes cleanly
- a clear primary target or targets in scope documented for teammates
- a clear runtime choice or runtime policy by target
- a CI-friendly path that can be repeated on another machine

## 1. Start From The Narrowest Stable Path

Use the strongest default path unless you have a real reason not to:

```bash
plugin-kit-ai init my-plugin
cd my-plugin
plugin-kit-ai render .
plugin-kit-ai validate . --platform codex-runtime --strict
```

This gives you the cleanest base for later handoff.

## 2. Make The Choice Explicit

A team-ready repo should say, at minimum:

- which target is primary and which additional targets are genuinely supported
- which runtime it uses and whether that changes by target
- what the main validation command is, or what validation commands are required for a multi-target repo
- whether it depends on a Go SDK path or a shared runtime package

If that information is only in one maintainer's head, the repo is not ready.

## 3. Keep The Repository Honest

Before you expand the project, enforce three rules:

- the project source lives in the package-standard layout
- generated target files are outputs
- `render` and `validate --strict` remain part of the normal workflow

Do not patch rendered files by hand and then hope the team never reruns generation.

## 4. Add A Repeatable CI Gate

The minimum gate should look like this:

```bash
plugin-kit-ai doctor .
plugin-kit-ai render .
plugin-kit-ai validate . --platform codex-runtime --strict
```

If the chosen path is Node or Python, include `bootstrap` and pin the runtime version in CI.

If the repo supports multiple targets, the CI gate should check each supported target explicitly rather than assuming indirect coverage.

## 5. Check Whether You Actually Need A Different Path

Only move away from the default path when the tradeoff is real:

- use `claude` when Claude hooks are the product requirement
- use `node --typescript` when the team is TypeScript-first and the local runtime tradeoff is acceptable
- use `python` when the project is intentionally local to the repo and Python-first

Changing lanes should solve a product or team problem, not just mirror language preference.

If the product is truly multi-target, say that directly: the repo has a primary path, but it also carries additional targets inside the supported scope.

## 6. Make Handoff Visible

A new teammate should be able to answer these questions from the repo and docs:

- how do I install prerequisites?
- what command proves the repo is healthy?
- what target am I validating for?
- which files are authored state and which are generated?

If the answer to any of those is “ask the original author,” the repo is still not ready.

## 7. Link The Repo Back To The Public Contract

A team-ready plugin repo should point people to:

- [Production Readiness](/en/guide/production-readiness)
- [CI Integration](/en/guide/ci-integration)
- [Repository Standard](/en/reference/repository-standard)
- the current public release note, now [v1.0.6](/en/releases/v1-0-6)

## Final Rule

The repo is ready when another teammate can clone it, understand the chosen path, reproduce the rendered outputs, and pass the strict validation gate without improvisation.
